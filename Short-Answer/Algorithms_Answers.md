## Exercise I
a) O(n) It's dependent upon the input size. Runs one while statement (condition) and returns a math operation as the only given information

b) O(n^2) You have an iteration and a nested condition so each time it does the outer loop the inner loop runs.

c) O(n) We have a single operation based on input size
